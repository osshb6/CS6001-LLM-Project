148,unknown,MCQ,Can Homo habilis tools remain effective for modern prey?,d,No—their hand morphology prevents using tools effectively,B,b,"Yes, through tool-design adaptation and hunting-tactic modification",0
149,unknown,TF,"If Paranthropus maintained hyper-specialized jaw morphology in modern woodland, would dietary specialization create adaptive advantage or liability?",a,True,False,b,False,0
150,unknown,MCQ,Does Paranthropus specialization help or hurt?,d,Liability—their jaw muscles create exhaustion during extended foraging,B,b,Liability—resource variation would create frequent starvation,0
